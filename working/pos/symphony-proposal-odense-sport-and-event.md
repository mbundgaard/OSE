## Executive Summary

Following our productive discussion about modernizing your point-of-sale operations, we're pleased to present our proposal for implementing Oracle Simphony POS with Muneris Mobile Ordering at Odense Sport & Event.

This solution addresses your need for flexible payment and ordering capabilities across restaurant, conference, and event operations while positioning you perfectly for the Opera PMS migration in March 2026. By starting the Simphony project in early 2026, you'll have ample time for configuration, training, and testing - ensuring a smooth transition when Opera goes live.

## Solution Overview

The combination of Simphony POS and Muneris Mobile Ordering creates a unified system that replaces your current Event POS while providing the flexibility your operations require.

**Core Simphony POS System**  
Four fixed workstations provide the foundation for your restaurant and bar operations. These stations can manage all aspects of the restaurant operation, handling complex orders, split bills, and comprehensive system oversight. The system integrates seamlessly with Opera PMS when it launches in March 2026, enabling room charging across all revenue centers.

**Muneris Mobile Ordering - Flexible Handheld Solution**  
Handheld terminals transform how your team serves guests, working anywhere on property via WiFi or 4G networks. All mobile devices are managed through an intuitive backend where configuration can be updated with a few clicks. Each device can be configured according to your needs and updated ad hoc as requirements change. The three configuration options are:

| Configuration | Monthly Cost | Capabilities | Ideal For |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|-----------|
| **Payment Only** | DKK 189 | • Process payments anywhere<br>• Accept all card types<br>• Digital receipts via QR code | • Conference registration<br>• Event payments<br>• Mobile cashier stations |
| **Ordering Only** | DKK 189 | • Take orders without payment<br>• Send to kitchen/bar<br>• Order tracking | • Table service (separate payment)<br>• Kitchen order stations |
| **Full Service** | DKK 337 | • Complete ordering capabilities<br>• Payment processing<br>• Quick Service Mode (10-20 items)<br>• Table Service Mode (full menu) | • Restaurant table service<br>• Breakfast sales at entrance<br>• Event bars and pop-ups<br>• Wardrobe services |

The license fee is invoiced retroactively according to what has been used each month - providing full transparency. You can easily switch device configurations as operational needs change, with billing automatically adjusting to reflect actual usage.

### Use Case Examples

**Breakfast Service**  
Instead of installing an additional Simphony workstation at the breakfast restaurant entrance, staff use a handheld device to sell breakfast to walk-in guests who don't have it included in their stay. Quick Service Mode makes this efficient with a simplified menu.

**Conference Operations**  
Your 38 conference rooms generate diverse requirements. Payment terminals handle registration and simple transactions, while ordering terminals manage coffee breaks, lunch service, and bar sales.

**Event Flexibility**  
Whether running a gala dinner for 500 guests or a small pop-up bar at a concert, the same devices adapt. Switch between Quick Service for fast bar sales or Table Service for seated dinners.

### Implementation Timeline

Starting in January 2026 provides the optimal preparation window:

| Phase | Timeline | Key Activities |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| **Project Kickoff** | Early January 2026 | • Oracle provisions Simphony environment<br>• Requirements gathering with your team<br>• Hardware planning and ordering |
| **Configuration** | Mid-January - Early February | • Menu and pricing setup<br>• Revenue center configuration<br>• Mobile Ordering deployment<br>• Test workstation installation |
| **Training & Testing** | February 2026 | • Super-user training (restaurant manager, supervisors)<br>• Staff familiarization<br>• Parallel testing with current systems |
| **Go-Live Preparation** | Early March 2026 | • Final configurations<br>• Opera integration testing<br>• Dress rehearsal |
| **Go-Live** | March 2026 | • Launch with Opera PMS<br>• On-site Muneris support<br>• Post-implementation optimization |

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

### Investment Overview

Simphony POS licenses and workstations are purchased directly through Oracle. Muneris provides the Mobile Ordering software and consultancy services for implementation and training. Mobile devices are purchased and owned by Odense Sport & Event.

**Consultancy Services**

| Component | Days | Investment |
|-----------|------|------------|
| System setup and configuration | 2.5 | DKK 24,000 |
| Training (super-users and staff) | 2.5 | DKK 24,000 |
| Menu configuration and testing | 1.5 | DKK 14,400 |
| Hardware setup and deployment | 2.0 | DKK 19,200 |
| **Total Consultancy Services** | **8.5** | **DKK 81,600** |

*Rate: DKK 1,200 per hour (DKK 9,600 per day based on 8-hour workday, plus VAT). This is our honest assessment without contingency. Material changes to scope would be addressed through change requests.*

**Hardware Investment**

| Item | Unit Cost | Quantity | Total |
|------|-----------|----------|-------|
| Handheld terminal (no printer) | ~DKK 2,100 | 10-12 units | ~DKK 25,000 |
| Handheld terminal (with printer) | ~DKK 2,700 | 5-8 units | ~DKK 16,000 |
| **Estimated Hardware Total** | | **15-20 units** | **~DKK 40,000** |

*We recommend purchasing directly from suppliers. You own the hardware outright.*

**Monthly Software Costs**

| License Type | Quantity | Monthly Cost |
|--------------|----------|--------------|
| Payment terminals | 8-10 units | DKK 1,512-1,890 |
| Ordering terminals | 5-7 units | DKK 945-1,323 |
| Full service terminals | 2-3 units | DKK 674-1,011 |
| **Estimated Monthly Total** | **15-20 terminals** | **DKK 3,131-4,224** |

*All Mobile Ordering licenses include Softpay payment application and Muneris support. Works with your existing payment acquirer. License fees invoiced retroactively based on actual usage for full transparency.*

### Why This Timeline Works

**Thorough Preparation**  
Two months of configuration and testing ensures your team is completely comfortable before going live. No surprises, no rushing.

**Parallel Testing**  
Run Simphony alongside your current system throughout February. Verify everything works perfectly before the March switchover.

**Synchronized Launch**  
When Opera goes live in March, Simphony is ready. Room charging, integrated reporting, and unified operations from day one.

**Local Support**  
Based in Køge, we're on-site during go-live and nearby whenever you need us afterward.

### Key Benefits

**Unified System**  
Replace separate Event POS terminals with one integrated solution across all revenue centers.

**Complete Flexibility**  
Mix payment and ordering terminals based on each location's needs. Reconfigure as requirements change.

**Future-Ready**  
Built for your expansion to 557 rooms. The same infrastructure scales with your growth.

**Proven Approach**  
We've implemented similar solutions for Danish hotels and restaurants. We understand both the technology and local market requirements.

### Next Steps

1. **Schedule Demo Session** - Live demonstration of Simphony POS and Mobile Ordering functionality tailored to your specific restaurant and event operations
2. **Project Timeline Confirmation** - Finalize January 2026 project start date to align with Opera PMS migration schedule (March 2026)
3. **Review Formal Quotes** - Oracle will provide Simphony POS licensing and workstation quotes, while Muneris provides implementation quotes
4. **Project Kickoff** - Establish project team, confirm training participants, and begin system configuration planning

We're excited about the opportunity to modernize your point-of-sale operations and support your expansion. The combination of Simphony POS and Muneris Mobile Ordering will transform how you serve guests across all touchpoints while positioning you perfectly for continued growth.
