## Round-Based Ordering System

### Understanding Rounds
Muneris Mobile Ordering uses a flexible round-based system that allows multiple order additions to a single customer check:

- **Round 1**: Initial order (appetizers, drinks, main courses)
- **Round 2**: Additional items (desserts, more drinks)
- **Round 3+**: Further additions as needed
- **Flexible posting**: Each round can be posted to POS independently

### Round Management
- **Start new round** when customer wants to add items to existing check
- **Post rounds individually** to kitchen for optimal service timing
- **View all rounds** on single check for complete order overview
- **Modify unpsted rounds** before sending to kitchen

## Order Management Workflows

### Starting a New Order
1. **Open Muneris app** on configured device
2. **Select "New Order"** to begin customer check
3. **Choose table/location** if table management enabled
4. **Begin adding items** from synchronized menu

### Adding Items to Orders
1. **Browse menu categories** to find items
2. **Tap menu items** to add to current round
3. **Modify quantities** using +/- buttons
4. **Add special instructions** for kitchen preparation
5. **Review round** before posting to POS

### Menu Navigation
- **Category browsing**: Organized by restaurant's Simphony menu structure
- **Search function**: Quick item lookup by name
- **Item details**: Prices, descriptions, and preparation notes
- **Modifiers available**: Options, sizes, preparation preferences
- **Real-time pricing**: Current prices from Oracle Simphony system

## Check Management

### Multi-Round Check Operations
- **View all rounds** on single check display
- **Post rounds individually** for kitchen timing control
- **Add new rounds** to existing checks anytime
- **Modify unposted rounds** before kitchen submission
- **Check totals update** automatically with each round

### Check Coordination Across Devices
Multiple devices can work on the same check:

- **Shared check access**: Any device can view and modify active checks
- **Real-time updates**: Changes appear immediately on all devices
- **Round assignment**: Clear indication of which device created each round
- **Conflict prevention**: System manages simultaneous modifications
- **Status synchronization**: Posted/unposted status visible to all team members

### Order Modifications
#### Before Posting to Kitchen
- **Add/remove items** freely within current round
- **Modify quantities** and special instructions
- **Change modifiers** and preparation options
- **Split items** between different rounds if needed

#### After Posting to Kitchen
- **New rounds required** for additional items
- **Cancellations** may require kitchen/manager coordination
- **Modifications** depend on kitchen preparation status
- **POS integration** maintains order accuracy

## Team Coordination

### Multi-Device Restaurant Operations
- **Seamless handoffs**: Staff can pick up any check on any device
- **Real-time visibility**: All staff see current order status
- **Team communication**: Visual indicators show who's working on what
- **Load balancing**: Distribute orders across multiple devices/staff

### Device Role Management
- **Any device can start orders**: No device-specific restrictions
- **Flexible assignments**: Staff can switch between devices as needed
- **Manager oversight**: Check status visible across all devices
- **Backup capabilities**: Other devices continue if one fails

### Communication Features
- **Order status indicators**: Visual cues for posted/unposted rounds
- **Device identification**: Shows which device/staff member created each round
- **Time stamps**: Track when orders and rounds were created
- **Kitchen communication**: Special instructions visible to all staff

## Performance Optimization

### Efficient Order Entry
- **Menu memorization**: Frequently used items for faster entry

### Battery and Device Management
- **Charge devices regularly**: Maintain power throughout service
- **Screen timeout settings**: Balance visibility with battery conservation

- **Contact IT support** for persistent connectivity issues

### Menu Item Issues
- **Refresh menu** if items appear unavailable

- **Verify pricing updates** from POS system
- **Report menu discrepancies** to management

### Multi-Device Coordination Problems
- **Restart all devices** if team coordination fails
- **Check network status** on all devices
